# User Interface Programming
To run this repository use Python 3.11.5 (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3115/):  
- pip install -r requirements.txt  
- Inside library_management/ run: py manage.py runserver 'port' 

We recommend to use port 8000 or 8080 (by default django uses 8000)

For my part of the project I used port 8080 to run the backend (My pc for some reason doesn't support 8000) so the command to run is --> py manage.py runserver 8080.
